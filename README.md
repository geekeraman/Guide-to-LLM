# Guide-to-LLM  

This repository is a **tutorial guide for new Lab members** to build strong foundations in **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)** before starting research on **large language models (LLMs)**.  

---

## 👋 Welcome!  

We are very excited about your enthusiasm to join our Lab. Before becoming a full member of the team, we want to make sure you have a solid foundation in ML and DL. This knowledge is essential for:  
- Understanding research papers  
- Reading and writing code  
- Building toward your own research goals

## 📚 Learning Path  

👉 **No ML background? No problem!**  
The following courses will guide you step by step in learning ML and DL, giving you the strong foundation needed to begin working with LLMs.  

👉 **Already familiar with ML?**  
We still encourage you to review the slides and courses—you may discover new insights you didn’t know before.  

The core preparation includes **4–5 courses from Deeplearning.AI by Prof. Andrew Ng**.  
- After completing each key course, you will go through an **oral evaluation**.  
- Once finished, if you are unsure where to start, we will provide **tasks and research directions** so you can explore the world of AI.
