# Guide-to-LLM  

This repository is a **tutorial guide for new Lab members** to build strong foundations in **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)** before starting research on **large language models (LLMs)**.  

---

## 👋 Welcome!  

We are very excited about your enthusiasm to join our Lab. Before becoming a full member of the team, we want to make sure you have a solid foundation in ML and DL. This knowledge is essential for:  
- Understanding research papers  
- Reading and writing code  
- Building toward your own research goals  


## 📚 Learning Path  

👉 **No ML background? No problem!**  
The following courses will guide you step by step in learning ML and DL, giving you the strong foundation needed to begin working with LLMs.  

👉 **Already familiar with ML?**  
We still encourage you to review the slides and courses—you may discover new insights you didn’t know before.  

The core preparation includes **4–5 courses from Deeplearning.AI by Prof. Andrew Ng**.  
- After completing each key course, you will go through an **oral evaluation**.  
- Once finished, if you are unsure where to start, we will provide **tasks and research directions** so you can explore the world of AI.

## 🖥️ Computing Resources  

You don’t need to worry about computational power.  
Our University  now has a **DGX server—** which will fully support your experiments and research.  


## 🌊 Research Opportunities  

We are living in an exciting wave of AI innovation, and there are many open areas where your talent can make a real impact:  

- **Quantization**  
- **Fine-tuning**  
- **Knowledge Distillation**  
- **Efficient LLM Techniques**  

These methods are not only crucial for **language models**, but also for **vision-language models (VLLMs)** and **AI agents**.  


## 🚀 Your Research Career Starts Here  

By completing this guide, you will be ready to contribute to cutting-edge projects in AI and LLM research.  
We look forward to seeing your growth and contributions in the Lab!

## 📖 Learning Procedure  

We will start with **Machine Learning (ML) fundamentals** before moving to **Deep Learning (DL)**, since deep learning is essentially an advanced extension of ML.  

### Step 1: Machine Learning Specialization (Coursera)  

We will use the **Machine Learning Specialization** by [Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction).  
This series has 3 courses, but for our preparation you only need to complete the first 2:  

1. [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)  
2. [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)  

> 🔑 These two courses will provide the foundation needed to understand ML principles before moving to deep learning.  

---

### Step 2: Alternative Access (if you don’t have Coursera access)  

If you don’t have Coursera access, you can still follow the learning process:  

1. **Watch the free YouTube lectures**  
   - [DeepLearning.AI Machine Learning Specialization Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vStJoetOxJg&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6FNC6YRfRQc_FbeQrF8BwGI)  
   - Each video is organized as `[Course X, Week Y, Lesson Z]`, so you can easily track progress.  

2. **Do the corresponding labs locally**  
   - After watching a lesson, open the matching lab from this repository and complete it.  

---

### Step 3: Environment Setup  

Before starting, make sure you have the required tools installed:  

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**  
   - Install through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install), or  
   - Create a new virtual environment and install Jupyter manually.  

2. **Install Git**  
   - Download and install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  

3. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/greyhatguy007/Machine-Learning-Specialization-Coursera.git
   cd Machine-Learning-Specialization-Coursera
   ```

4. **Navigate to the course folder**

   ```bash
   cd "C1 - Supervised Machine Learning - Regression and Classification"
   ```

From here, follow the notebooks step by step to reinforce the concepts from the videos/courses.

### Step 4: Deep Learning Specialization 

After completing the Machine Learning courses, we continue with the **Deep Learning Specialization** by [Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).  
This specialization has 5 courses, but for our core preparation you only need to complete the first 2:  

1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)  
2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)  

These two courses explain the transition from **machine learning to deep learning**, introducing key concepts such as neural networks, hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and optimization. By finishing them, you will gain a **solid understanding of neural networks**, which will support your future research.  

> ✅ **Mandatory courses end here.**  

For those who want to go further, I personally recommend continuing with the **5th course of the specialization**:  

- [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models?specialization=deep-learning)  

This course introduces **attention mechanisms and transformer architectures**—concepts that were first developed in NLP, later expanded to computer vision, and are now the foundation of modern LLMs.

### 🚀 Alternative Access  

If you don’t have access to Coursera, you can still follow the Deep Learning Specialization in two steps:  

1. **Watch the YouTube lectures**  
   - [Deep Learning Specialization Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS4cs9xVecg&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0)  

2. **Install the course materials from GitHub**  
   - Clone the official repository:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/amanchadha/coursera-deep-learning-specialization.git
     cd coursera-deep-learning-specialization
     ```  
   - Use these notebooks to complete the labs that correspond to each video lesson.
